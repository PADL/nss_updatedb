                        ============

nss_updatedb is a simple tool for dumping users and groups
from a nameservice into a local database. Along with the
pam_ccreds module, also available from PADL, this allows
for disconnected use of nameservice information.

To configure, one would typically put something like the
following in /etc/nsswitch.conf:

passwd:	files ldap [NOTFOUND=return] db
group:	files ldap [NOTFOUND=return] db

and then configure nss_updatedb to be run from a cron job.

The usage is:

# nss_updatedb [nameservice] [passwd|group]

If [passwd|group] is not specified, then both the passwd
and group maps will be updated.

Examples:

Update /var/db/passwd.db from LDAP:

# nss_updatedb ldap passwd

Update /var/db/passwd.db & /var/db/group.db from LDAP:

# nss_updatedb ldap

Update /var/db/group.db from NIS+:

# nss_updatedb nisplus group

The databases written out are /var/db/passwd.db and
/var/db/group.db; these are compatible with the nss_db
module distributed with the GNU C Library.
